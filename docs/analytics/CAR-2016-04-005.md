A remote desktop logon, through [RDP](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1076/), may be typical of a system administrator or IT support, but only from select workstations. Monitoring remote desktop logons and comparing to known/approved originating systems can detect lateral movement of an adversary.

## ATT&CK Detection

|Technique |Tactic |Level of Coverage |
|---|---|---|
|[Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)|[Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008)|Moderate|

## Pseudocode
Look in the system logs for remote logons using RDP 
```
[EventCode] == 4624 and
[AuthenticationPackageName] == 'Negotiate' and
[Severity] == "Information" and
[LogonType] == 10
```
