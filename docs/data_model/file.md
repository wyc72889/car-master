## Fields

|Field|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|creation_time|The creation time of the file as described in UTC and including the date.|`05/14/2015 12:47:06`|
|file_name|The name of the file.|`MyWordDoc.docx`|
|fqdn|The fully qualified domain name of the host. Contains the hostname appended with the domain.|`HOST1.EXAMPLE_DOMAIN.COM`|
|hostname|The hostname of the host, without the domain.|`HOST1`|
|image_path|The file system location of the executable that is associated with the `pid` that generated this event.|`C:\Windows\system32\notepad.exe`|
|md5_hash|An MD5 hash of the contents of the file located at `image_path`. The field is in hex notation, without the 0x prefix.|`5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3`|
|pid|The process ID for the process that generated this file event, represented in decimal notation.|`738`|
|ppid|The process ID of the parent process of the process associated with this file event, represented in decimal notation.|`1860`|
|previous_creation_time|The creation_time associated with the file before it was changed for this file event.|`05/14/2015 12:47:06`|
|signer|The company listed on the certificate of the program at `image_path` if that program is signed.|`Microsoft |Corporation`
|sha1_hash|The SHA1 hash of the contents of the file located at `image_path`.|`2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed`|
|sha256_hash|The SHA256 hash of the contents of the file located at `image_path`.|`68e656b251e67e8358bef8483ab0d51c6619f3e7a1a9f0e75838d41ff368f728`|
|user|The user context in which the thread that caused this event was running. May be a local, domain or SYSTEM user. Formatted as "\<DOMAIN>\\\<USER>". Because threads are allowed to impersonate users, this may be different than the user context of the process.|`HOST1\LOCALUSER`|
|company|The name of the organization listed in the file located at `image_path`.
|file_path|The full path to the file.|`C:\users\fakeuser\documents\MyFile.docx`|
