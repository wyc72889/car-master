title: "Module"
---

Modules correspond to executable (and potentially non-executable) content, and are loaded as a contiguous region of memory into the address space of a process. Each process will have the main image loaded as a module and shared libraries (DLLs in Windows) and their dependencies.

## Actions

|Action|Description|
|---|---|
|load|A module load event occurs when a PE image (dll or exe) is loaded into a process.
|unload|When the module is unloaded from memory, upon destruction of the process or by calling an API such as FreeLibrary, the unload event is triggered.

## Fields

|Field|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|base_address|A hex address indicating where the module is loaded into the processâ€™s virtual address space|`0xFFFFF8000405F000`
|fqdn|The fully qualified domain name of the host. Contains the hostname appended with the domain.|`HOST1.EXAMPLE_DOMAIN.COM`
|hostname|The hostname of the active host, without the domain.|`HOST1`
|image_path|The file system location of the process image.|`C:\path\to\example.exe`
|md5_hash|The MD5 hash of the contents of the file located at `module_path`. The field is in hex notation, without the 0x prefix.|`5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3`
|module_path|The full file system path to the module loaded into the memory space of the process.|`C:\windows\system32\kernel32.exe`
|module_name|The name of the file where the module is loaded on disk. This is also the string that is used internally by the program to lookup information about the module.|`kernel32.exe`
|pid|Process ID of the process in which the module is loaded (or unloaded).|`738`
|sha1_hash|The SHA1 hash of the contents of the file located at `image_path`.|`2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed`
|sha256_hash|The SHA256 hash of the contents of the file located at `image_path`.|`68e656b251e67e8358bef8483ab0d51c6619f3e7a1a9f0e75838d41ff368f728`
|signer|The name of the organization which signed the module.|`Microsoft Corporation`
|tid|The thread ID of the thread responsible for the load or unload event.|`50`
